# CharArrayWriter and CharArrayReader in java
## Description
Suppose you need to process data ad hoc in an application, 
and instead of using file or network connections, 
you process the data directly in memory. 
In this scenario, we use CharArrayWriter to store the data as a 
character array and then use CharArrayReader to read this data.
